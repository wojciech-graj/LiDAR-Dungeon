### LiDAR Dungeon
![Cover](screenshots/cover.png)

Fight enemies and collect upgrades as you traverse the depths of a procedurally-generated spaceship, seeing only that which your LiDAR reveals.

It can be played online [here](https://wojciech-graj.itch.io/lidar-dungeon), although dowloading the game will provide a better gaming experience. Downloads can be found in the releases sidebar.

Made in 7 days using the TIC-80 for the [7DRL2023](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2023) GameJam.

Requires Mouse/Touchpad + Keyboard to play. Controls can be remapped by pressing ESC, then navigating to options. Press Z to toggle music.
